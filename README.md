# Composer Controller

## MIDI and OSC controller by composer for composers.

**Read this first!**

Composer Controller at the moment is compatible for Mac and Chrome browser only. In the near future it will be compatible for Windows and Safari.

**What Composer Controller is**

Composer Controller is an all-in-one solution designed to facilitate composers workflow and to control your DAW or virtual instruments within every device that run a browser.
It has been inspired by [Junkie XL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSl_unnPab0``) and [Hans Zimmer](http://cdm.link/2012/10/interview-mark-wherry-man-behind-hollywoods-digital-musical-instruments-hans-zimmer-collaborator/) custom made touch screens solutions.
The goal is that it's no longer necessary to have a mobile device with an app downloaded from a store and a separate desktop software to edit your boards. 
With the same web interface now you can create your boards, assign MIDI and OSC messages, edit elements styles (buttons, sliders and labels) and monitoring messages. 
The Composer Controller desktop app is only aimed to serve through the network lan your boards, monitor error messages and backup/import your boards. 

**Installation**

Go [here](https://github.com/alearcy/composer_controller/releases) and download the .dmg file from the latest release.

**First launch**

The first time you launch the app, a window will appear and show the address that you have to copy and paste in your Chrome browser. Then, you will see an empty board.
